Description
===========

Bulkrename allows you to pipe a list of filenames and to rename them
interactively within your editor. It is inspired by ranger's bulkrename
command (see http://nongnu.org/ranger/).

Why ?
=====

When dealing with a great number of files, or having the same modification to
do a lot of time it it often easier to do it in our well-known editor.

Documentation
=============

Just pipe a list of files to bulkrename.

If your $EDITOR environment variable is not set, vi will be called.

License
=======

The code is under the WTFPL (see http://www.wtfpl.net/) mainly because I
wanted to stay at 42 lines of code and the GPLv3 was too long.
